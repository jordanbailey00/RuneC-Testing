# rc-content/encounters

One `.c` file per boss encounter. Holds the **boss-specific scripts**
referenced by the encounter's TOML `script = "..."` fields. Does NOT
hold generic primitives (those live in `rc-core/encounter_prims.c`).

See the parent `rc-content/README.md` for the engine/content split
rationale. This README covers the per-encounter specifics.

Use this file for:
- what encounter modules are for
- what belongs here versus in TOML or `rc-core`
- how encounter files are organized
- how encounter code relates to encounter data

---

## What belongs in this directory

**In-scope (goes here):**
- Boss-specific phase scripts — e.g. `scurrius_heal_at_food_pile`,
  `kq_shed_exoskeleton`, `vorkath_acid_phase_transition`.
- Boss-specific attack rotations that don't generalize — e.g. Zulrah's
  tick-indexed phase rotation, Olm's hand-vs-head coordination.
- Boss-specific environmental setup (if not expressible in TOML).

**Out of scope (goes elsewhere):**
- Generic primitives used by ≥2 bosses — `rc-core/encounter_prims.c`.
- NPC stat data (hp, max_hit, attack_types) — `data/defs/npc_defs.bin`
  via `tools/export_npc_defs_full.py` into the local `RuneC-DB` checkout.
- Attack / phase / mechanic *data* — `data/curated/encounters/<boss>.toml`
  → `data/defs/encounters.bin` via `tools/export_encounters.py`.
- Drops — `data/defs/drops.bin`.

**The test:** if you can express the behavior in TOML + a generic
primitive that another boss could reuse, it doesn't belong here.
Only *genuinely one-off* code lives in these files.

## Relationship to encounter data

Encounter behavior is split across three layers:
- `data/curated/encounters/<boss>.toml`
  - boss data: attacks, phases, mechanics, params; owned by `RuneC-DB`
- `rc-core/encounter_prims.c`
  - reusable generic mechanic implementations referenced by
    `primitive = "..."`
- `rc-content/encounters/<boss>.c`
  - one-off boss logic referenced by `script = "..."`

If a mechanic can be described as reusable behavior with parameters, it
belongs in the primitive layer, not here.

## File structure

One `.c` file per encounter, named after the TOML slug:

```
encounters/
├── README.md                (this file)
├── scurrius.c               → data/curated/encounters/scurrius.toml
├── kalphite_queen.c         → data/curated/encounters/kalphite_queen.toml
├── scripts.c                → shared no-op registry for authored hooks
├── vorkath.c                → data/curated/encounters/vorkath.toml
└── ...
```

`scripts.c` is not boss behavior. It registers currently authored
`script = "..."` names to a no-op function so ENCT v3 routing is
validated while the real per-boss implementations are still being
authored.

For multi-file encounters (raids with many rooms, wave bosses like
Inferno with per-wave logic), use a subdirectory:

```
encounters/
├── chambers_of_xeric/
│   ├── chambers_of_xeric.c       (entry + register)
│   ├── olm.c                     (final boss)
│   ├── tekton.c                  (room mini-bosses)
│   └── ...
├── inferno/
│   ├── inferno.c                 (wave progression)
│   ├── zuk.c                     (final boss)
│   └── ...
```

The register fn always lives in the entry file and is named for the
encounter slug: `rc_content_chambers_of_xeric_register`.

## Per-encounter file template

```c
#include "../content.h"

// <Boss Name> — <1-sentence summary>.
// Cache NPC id(s): <list>.
//
// MOST of <Boss> runs on generic primitives in rc-core. The TOML at
// `data/curated/encounters/<slug>.toml` references:
//   - <primitive_name>  <TOML mechanic name>  — generic
//   - <primitive_name>  <TOML mechanic name>  — generic
//
// This file exists to hold the *boss-specific* scripts listed in
// the TOML's `script = "..."` fields:
//
//   - <script_name>
//       <what it does + why it can't be expressed as a generic primitive>
//
// Reference: <either "no pre-2013 counterpart (OSRS-only)" OR
//             "rsmod/void/2011Scape overlap source — see ...">

// ---- Boss-specific scripts (static — not exported) --------------------

// static void <script_name>(struct RcWorld *world, int enc_idx,
//                           const void *params) {
//     // ...
// }

// ---- Registration ------------------------------------------------------

void rc_content_<slug>_register(struct RcWorld *world) {
    (void)world;
    // Register encounter-specific hooks exposed by this module.
}
```

## Reference sources

Per `rc-content/README.md`:
- `rsmod` is the modern OSRS engine/code reference when it has the
  needed encounter
- `void_rsps` and `2011Scape-game` are overlap-only references for
  older shared content
- OSRS-only encounters still require wiki reconstruction

### Overlap-boss checklist

When porting from a reference repo:

1. Verify the boss exists in OSRS and pre-2013 RS.
2. Locate the source script (search `rsmod/content/`,
   `void_rsps/game/npcs/`, `2011Scape-game/src/main/java/org/wildscape/game/world/`).
3. Read the wiki for OSRS-specific divergences (OSRS sometimes
   rebalanced old content — max hits, drop rates, attack speeds
   can differ).
4. Port the **logic** to C. Don't port data (stats, drops) — those
   already live in our binaries from Phase 1-2.
5. Comment the source in the script file (see template above).
6. Write a regression test asserting at least one attack rotation
   or damage value matches the wiki.

### OSRS-only reconstruction checklist

1. Scrape the boss page + strategies page (already done — cached
   in `tools/wiki_cache/`).
2. Read the wiki mechanics section + infobox + strategies.
3. Encode phases / attacks / mechanic triggers in the TOML.
4. For anything not expressible in the existing primitive set,
   author a boss-specific script in this directory.
5. Regression test against wiki-stated HP curves, attack cadence,
   phase transitions.
